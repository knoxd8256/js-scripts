/* Durham tech is hosting an event for students to attend
*  various presentations around campus. A presentation
*  may have many students attending and a student may attend
*  many presentations.
*
*  Your task is to implement the registration system.
*  Given a list of presentations, you should request
*  and record the names of the students attending.
*  A blank entry should terminate and move to the next
*  presentation. After recording the attendee names
*  for each presentation, a prompt should allow the
*  user to provide a presentation name to receive
*  a list of the students attending.
*
*  Use window.prompt and window.alert to request
*  and provide user feedback.
