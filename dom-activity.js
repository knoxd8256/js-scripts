*  The document object provides a number of methods and
*  properties to access and manipulate elements. Given the
*  provided HTML file, manipulate the header, paragraph,
*  and list items.
*
*  The HTML file contains:
*   -h1 header
*   -p paragraph
*   -ul unordered list
*     -li (3x) list items
*
*  You can choose how to select the elements
*  (by class, tag, id, etc) and what text to fill
*  the elements with. Your manipulation should be
*  done fully from javascript and you should not
*  modify the html file directly.
*
*  Requirements:
*   -Every element should have text (h1, p, li)
*   -At least 2 elements should have styles applied
*   -The ul only has 3 li, add a 4th *to the list*
*
